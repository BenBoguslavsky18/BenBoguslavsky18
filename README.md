Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:
- 🤖 Collision-avoiding KUKA & Sawyer robot arms for HRI research
- 🔍 Real-time AI-based defect detection systems in C++ with YOLO, OpenCV, and ONNX Runtime with CUDA & TensorRT Execution Providers
- 🕶️ A VR shopping app where you you can try on clothes from online stores (Hack the North)
- ⚙️ Embedded systems: STM32, sensor interfacing, motor control
